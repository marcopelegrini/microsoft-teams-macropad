# Microsoft Teams

OK, this is the tricky part if you're not working for Microsoft.

> This required modifications to Microsoft Teams which are not publicly available yet. So be aware that to take the full advantage of this project you might need to wait until those changes makes into the public available version.<br/><br/>
> Functions that work out-of-the-box are Mute/Unmute and Haise/Lower hands<br/><br/>
> You can also program any of [Microsoft Teams Shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-for-microsoft-teams-2e8e2a70-e8d8-4a19-949b-4c36dd5292d2) to the other keys instead of the reactions/Copilot ones

If you're part of Microsoft, reach out to me for details.
